# `Abstractive::Refrescar`

Code reloader, implemented using Celluloid and rb-inotify.

This [currently](#Future) only runs on `Linux` because it uses `inotify`.


## Usage

To use this gem, you need to initialize it like this:

```
#de Example here.
```


## Future

Will update to detect and support `Mac OS X` ( using `FSEvent` versus `inotify` ) and other *nix operating systems.
